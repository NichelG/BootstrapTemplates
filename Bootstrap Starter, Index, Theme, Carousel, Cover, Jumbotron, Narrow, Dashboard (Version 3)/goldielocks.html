					<p class="well">At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge.  Goldilocks was hungry.  She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.</p>

					<p class="well"><span class="label label-danger">This porridge is too hot!"</span> she exclaimed.<br />
					So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.<br />
					<span class="label label-danger">"This porridge is too cold,"</span> she said<br />
					So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.<br />
					<span class="label label-danger">"Ahhh, this porridge is just right,"</span> she said happily and she ate it all up.</p>
